# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here
The changes made to the deterministicPartitionKey function result in a clearer, more readable code. This is achieved through the use of modern JavaScript syntax, such as destructuring and template literals, which make the code more concise and easier to follow. The inclusion of named constants and the use of separate functions to generate the hash also adds clarity to the code, as it is evident what values are being referred to without the need for comments or additional information. Overall, these modifications result in a cleaner and simpler code that is easier to maintain and understand for future developers.
